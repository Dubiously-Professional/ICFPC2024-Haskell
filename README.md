# ICFPC2024-Haskell

Haskell implementation of [ICFPC 2024](https://icfpcontest2024.github.io/task.html) interpreter. To use this, you will need to run a local copy of the contest server following the instructions [here](https://github.com/icfpcontest2024/icfpc2024)

To build the project, run

```
stack build
```

then go get yourself a cup of coffee, work on some chores, maybe start on that novel you've been meaning to write. With any luck, by the time you are finished with all that, the project will be ready to run. I have implemented a simple terminal which you can run with

```
stack exec communicator
```

a good starting command is

```
get index
```
